We complete our computations of topological Hochschild homology of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum $\B$ at the primes $2,3$ with coefficients in $\tBP{1}$. At the prime $p=2$ we use the model for $\B$ constructed by Lawson-Naumann \cite{LawsonNaumann} using topological modular forms equipped with a $\Gamma_1(3)$-structure and at $p=3$ we use the model for $\B$ constructed using a Shimura curve of discriminant $14$ due to Hill-Lawson \cite{HillLawson}. A key part of the proof involves constructing a structured Postnikov tower and a structured Whitehead tower for $\B$ with filtration quotients in $\ell$-modules, which we believe should have independent interest.
