We compute topological Hochschild homology of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum $\B$ at the primes $2,3$ with coefficients in $\tBP{1}$. At the prime $p=2$ we use the model for $\B$ constructed by Lawson-Naumann \cite{LawsonNaumann} using topological modular forms equipped with a $\Gamma_1(3)$-structure and at $p=3$ we use the model for $\B$ constructed using a Shimura curve of discriminant $14$ due to Hill-Lawson \cite{HillLawson}.
