We compute mod $p$ topological Hochschild homology of the second truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum $\B$ at the prime $3$. We use the model for $\B$ constructed using Shimura curves of small discriminant due to Hill-Lawson \cite{HillLawson}. This is a first step towards a program of studying potential chromatic height three information in mod $p$ algebraic K-theory of $\B$.
