\section{Introduction}





\subsection{Conventions}
We write $L_{E}$ for Bousfield localization at a spectrum $E$. We write $BP\langle n\rangle$ for a family of $\mathbb{E}_{2}$-$\MU$-algebra forms of $BP\langle n\rangle$ such that 
\[\MU \to  \dots \to \BP\langle n\rangle\to  \BP\langle n-1\rangle\to  \dots  \to H\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}\to H\mathbb{F}_{p}\]
and therefore we fix classes $v_{i}$ such that on graded commutative rings
\[\MU_{*}\to  \BP\langle n\rangle_{*}\]
is given by sending $x_{p^{i}-1}$ to $v_{i}$ for $0\le i\le n$ (with $v_{0}=p$) and $x_{j}\mapsto 0$ otherwise. This also fixes the map of graded commutative rings 
\[  \BP\langle n\rangle_{*}\to  \BP\langle n-1\rangle_{*}\]
sending $v_{i}$ to $v_{i}$ for $0\le i\le n-1$ and $v_{n}\mapsto 0$. Such a family exists by~\cite{HW22}. Alternatively, when $n\le 2$ and $p\in \{2,3\}$, there are $\mathbb{E}_2$-$\mathrm{MU}$-algebra forms of $\mathrm{BP}\langle 2\rangle$ denoted $\tmf_1(3)$ and $\mathrm{taf}^{D}$ respectively, which have the extra property that their $\mathbb{E}_2$-algebra structures lift to $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-algebra structures by~\cite{HL10,LN12,LN14,CM15}.
